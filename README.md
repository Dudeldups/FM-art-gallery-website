## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

#### Added features

- Added the Leaflet JS Map, but it seems to be a bit buggy, moving the map and scrolling only works rarely. ðŸ˜’
